This is to ensure that at least the most important GUI functions
work properly.

Preparation
[ ] Don't use the 'experimental mode'!
[ ] Remove jar library from settings.
[ ] Make sure ghdl is installed.
[ ] Run the GUI tests! (digital/src/test/java/de/neemann/digital/integration/TestInGUI.java)

General
[ ] build a NOR based MS-JK-FF with diagonal wires, use Copy&Paste and 'L' shortcuts
[ ] save circuit
[ ] copy test case from the example (JK-MS.dig) to the created circuit
[ ] run tests
[ ] show test result in the timing diagram
[ ] undo and redo complete build

74xx
[ ] number the pins
[ ] remove all pin numbers
[ ] adding and removing prefixes
[ ] build a xor with two 7400
[ ] analyse the circuit

Remote Interface
[ ] start and stop "Conways Game of Live" (Conway.asm) via the assembler GUI in the
    processor (Processor.dig).
[ ] use "run to break" a few times
[ ] start debugger, step at least through a call instruction

Custom Jar Components
[ ] Copy actual Digital.jar to the plugin example, and start digital from the example
[ ] Remove jar from settings and load the test circuit containing the custom elements.
    An error message should be shown.
[ ] Create the jar and select it in the settings.
    Now load the example circuit. It should work.
[ ] Update the plugin example after release.
