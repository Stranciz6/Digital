Distribution Checklist

Checklist to be filled out before software is distributed.
This is to ensure that at least the most important GUI functions
work properly.
During test: Don't use the 'experimental mode'!

General
[ ] build a MS-JK-FF with diagonal wires, use Copy&Paste, 'L' and 'CTRL-S' shortcuts
[ ] copy test case from the example (JK-MS.dig) to the created circuit
[ ] run tests
[ ] show test result in the timing diagram
[ ] undo and redo complete build

74xx
[ ] number the pins
[ ] remove all pin numbers
[ ] adding and removing prefixes
[ ] build a xor with two 7400

Analysis
[ ] create circuit from the default expression
[ ] analyse circuit, result should to be "Y=B*C"

Truth Tables
[ ] create truth table of "two out of three" function, show KV map
[ ] create truth table of "4 input parity" function, show KV map
[ ] create 4 bit counter, build circuit with JK-FFs, check if it's running
[ ] build same circuit with D-FFs, check if it's running
[ ] create 8 bit up/down counter and start "ATF1502->TT2/JED" export. (Needs WinCupl to be installed!)

Remote Interface
[ ] start "Conways Game of Live" (Conway.asm) via the assembler GUI in the processor (Processor.dig).
[ ] use "run to break" a few times
[ ] start debugger, step at least through a call instruction
