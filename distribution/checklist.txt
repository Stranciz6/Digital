Distribution Checklist

Checklist to be filled out before software is distributed.
This is to ensure that at least the most important GUI functions
work properly.
Don't use the 'experimental mode'!

General
[ ] build a MS-JK-FF with diagonal wires, use Copy&Paste and 'L' shortcuts
[ ] save circuit
[ ] copy test case from the example (JK-MS.dig) to the created circuit
[ ] run tests
[ ] show test result in the timing diagram
[ ] undo and redo complete build

74xx
[ ] number the pins
[ ] remove all pin numbers
[ ] adding and removing prefixes
[ ] build a xor with two 7400

Analysis
[ ] create circuit from the default expression
[ ] analyse circuit, result should to be "Y=B*C"

Truth Tables
[ ] create truth table of "two out of three" function, show KV map
[ ] create truth table of "4 input parity" function, show KV map
[ ] create 4 bit counter, build circuit with JK-FFs, check if it's running
[ ] build same circuit with D-FFs, check if it's running
[ ] create 8 bit counter and start "ATF1502->TT2/JED" export.
    Info "Design fits successfully" should pop up. (Needs WinCupl to be installed!)

Remote Interface
[ ] start and stop "Conways Game of Live" (Conway.asm) via the assembler GUI in the
    processor (Processor.dig).
[ ] use "run to break" a few times
[ ] start debugger, step at least through a call instruction

Custom Jar Components
[ ] Copy actual Digital.jar to the plugin example, and start digital from the example
[ ] Remove jar from settings and load the test circuit containing the custom elements. Error message should be shown.
[ ] Set the jar and load the example circuit. If should work.
[ ] Update the plugin example after distribution
