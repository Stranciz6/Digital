            Digital is a simple simulator used to simulate digital circuits. The single logic gates are connected
            to each other by wires and the behaviour of the whole circuit is simulated.
            The user is able to interact with the circuit while it is running by pressing buttons or setting values
            to the inputs of the circuit.

            In this way you can build and simulate most of the fundamental circuits used in digital electronics.
            In the folder <e>examples</e> you can find many examples including a working single cycle harvard 16 bit
            processor.

    <chapter name="Propagation Delay">
        <par>
            During the simulation every logic gate has a propagation delay. Every component from the library
            has the same propagation delay regardless of its complexity.
            So a NOT gate has the same propagation delay as a RAM component or a flipflop.
            The only exceptions are diodes, switches and splitters which are used to create data buses.
            These components have no propagation delay at all.
        </par>
        <par>
            If a circuit is included in an other parent circuit, the included circuit keep its timing behaviour.
            So if you include a complex circuit which has a large propagation delay because on of the inputt signals has
            to pass three gates until it reaches the output, this behaviour is conserved while including this circuit.
            There are no additional delays coming up by including a circuit. If not all outputs of a circuit have
            the same propagation delay this is also the case if it is included in a parent circuit.
            In general, including a circuit into an other circuit does not modify its timing behaviour at all. A included
            circuit behave in exact the same way as if all components had been inserted in the same circuit level.

    <chapter name="Wires">
        <par>
            There are only connections between the end of a wire and a components pin. If you draw a straight wire across
            many component pins, there will be no connection between the pins and the wire at all.

            <question>When the simulation is started, a wire becomes gray. What does that mean?</question>
            <answer>The colors light green and dark green are used to represent high and low state.
                Gray means the wire is in high Z state.</answer>
