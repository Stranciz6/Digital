            There are only connections between the end of a wire and a components pin. If you draw a straight wire across
            many component pins, there wil be no connection between the pins and the wire at all.

            <question>How to move a component including all the connected wires?</question>
            <answer>Select the component with the rectangular selection. The selection must include the entire component.
                The move the component including the wires using the mouse.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
            <question>There is a component not connected to a wire, even though the pins are on the wire.</question>
            <answer>A pin is only connnected to a wire if the wire has an endpoint at the pin.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
            <question>When the simulation is started, a wire becomes gray. What does that mean?</question>
            <answer>The colors light green and dark green are used to represent high and low state. Gray means the wire is in high Z state.</answer>

            <question>I have a truth table. How to calculate the minimized boolean equations?</question>
            <answer>In the menu <e>Analysis</e> selct the entry <e>Synthesise</e>. Then enter the truth table.
                At the bottom of the window you can find the matching boolean equation. If you enter more than one
                dependent variable, a new window opens, in which all boolean functions are shown.</answer>
        </faq>
        <faq>
            <question>I have entered a truth table, but there are more then one boolean equation shown.
                Which of them is the correct one?</question>
            <answer>Minimizing a boolean equation can result in many equations, describing the same function.
                Digital shows all of them and they all create the same truth table.
                There may be differences according the don't cares in the truth table.</answer>
