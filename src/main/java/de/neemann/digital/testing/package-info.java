/**
 * Classes used to test a circuit.
 * You can add a test to a circuit like a regular gate.
 * There you can edit the test case and this test case can be run and the expected results are
 * compared with the calculated results.
 * It's somewhat like a unit test in java, but less flexible at the moment.
