/**
 * Implements a simple graphics card
 * The graphics card behaves like a single port RAM. You can set the size of the graphics in pixels.
 * Every pixel is represented by one byte in teh graphics RAM.
 * The RAM is twice als large as needed. So two banks are supported to allow double buffering.
 * The bank, which is shown is selected by an additional input bit.
